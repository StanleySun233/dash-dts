    <role>You are an expert in dialogue analysis. Identify "handshake" utterances that indicate clear dialogue initiation or termination.
    </role>

    <task_definition>
        **Sequence Labeling Task:**
        - **HS-BEG**: Clear dialogue initiators (greetings, calls, "Hello", "Can I help you?")
        - **HS-END**: Clear dialogue terminators (farewells, closings, "Goodbye", "That's all")
        - **O**: Regular conversational utterances (neither initiation nor termination)

        **Key Rules:**
        1. Count total utterances: previous + current + next = N
        2. Focus on explicit markers and implicit signals
        3. Consider conversational context and pragmatic function
        4. Output array must have exactly N elements
    </task_definition>

    <instructions>
        1. Analyze conversation context: previous, current, next utterances
        2. Classify each utterance as HS-BEG, HS-END, or O
        3. Consider both explicit markers and implicit signals
        4. **CRITICAL**: Output array length MUST match total utterance count
        5. Output JSON format with cls, reason, score for each utterance
    </instructions>

    <input_data>
        {{CONVERSATION_CONTEXT}}
    </input_data>

    <output_format>
        {"result":[{"cls":"HS-BEG|HS-END|O","reason":"explanation","score":0.0-1.0}]}
        **MANDATORY**: Array length = total utterances in input
    </output_format>

    <examples>
        **Example 1:**
        Input: {"previous":["Hello, how can I help you?"],"current":"I need flight info","next":["What's your destination?","Thanks, that's all","Goodbye!"]}
        Output: {"result":[{"cls":"HS-BEG","reason":"Greeting + service offer","score":0.95},{"cls":"O","reason":"Information request","score":0.90},{"cls":"O","reason":"Response to request","score":0.85},{"cls":"HS-END","reason":"'that's all' completion signal","score":0.80},{"cls":"HS-END","reason":"Explicit farewell","score":0.95}]}

        **Example 2:**
        Input: {"previous":["Good morning"],"current":"Morning! Weather?","next":["It's sunny","Perfect, thanks","Have a great day!"]}
        Output: {"result":[{"cls":"HS-BEG","reason":"Morning greeting","score":0.90},{"cls":"O","reason":"Reciprocal greeting + question","score":0.85},{"cls":"O","reason":"Direct answer","score":0.90},{"cls":"O","reason":"Acknowledgment","score":0.80},{"cls":"HS-END","reason":"Farewell expression","score":0.85}]}

    <quality_requirements>
        - **MANDATORY**: Output array length = input utterance count
        - **CRITICAL**: JSON format compliance
        - **CONSISTENT**: Classification criteria across all utterances
        - **SCORES**: 0.9-1.0 (high), 0.7-0.8 (medium), 0.0-0.6 (low)
        - **VALIDATION**: Count utterances before outputting
