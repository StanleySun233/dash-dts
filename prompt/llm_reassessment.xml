    <role>Expert in dialogue topic segmentation reassessment. Optimize consecutive segmentation predictions to ensure proper topic boundaries.</role>

    <task_definition>
        **Reassessment Task:**
        - Consecutive 1s (e.g., [0,1,1,0]) indicate multiple candidate boundaries
        - Typically select ONE position, but retain multiple 1s if CLEAR semantic topic shifts exist at well-separated positions
        - Set positions to 0 only if they don't represent genuine topic boundaries

        **Key Rules:**
        1. Prioritize genuine topic shifts and semantic breaks
        2. Accept small segments (1-2 utterances) if they represent distinct topics
        3. In Q-A patterns, each new question often marks a topic boundary
        4. Do NOT remove boundaries just because they create short segments - keep if topics are distinct
    </task_definition>

    <instructions>
        1. Analyze dialogue and current prediction with semantic focus
        2. Identify consecutive 1s range needing optimization
        3. For each position, evaluate genuine topic boundary:
           - Look for explicit topic changes, questions switching focus, or significant semantic shifts
           - **Q-A patterns**: Each new question often introduces a new topic
           - Consider if removing boundary would merge semantically distinct topics
        4. If one position has strongest semantic break, select that one; if multiple positions have legitimate distinct shifts, retain multiple 1s
        5. Output optimized prediction with clear reasoning

        **Current Prediction:** {{CURRENT_PREDICTION}}
        **Consecutive 1s Range:** {{CONSECUTIVE_RANGE}}

    <output_format>
        {"optimized_prediction":[0,1,0,0,1,0],"selected_position":2,"reasoning":"explanation","confidence":0.85}
        **Note**: Multiple 1s may be retained if they represent distinct legitimate boundaries.
    </output_format>

    <examples>
        **Example 1:**
        Dialogue: ["Hello","How are you?","I'm fine","What's the weather?"]
        Current: [0,1,1,0] → Optimized: [0,0,1,0]
        Reasoning: "Position 2 marks greeting-to-weather transition. Position 1 is redundant."

        **Example 2 (Multiple Boundaries):**
        Dialogue: ["Q1 about DMV","Answer","Q2 about sales","Answer","Q3 about timing","Answer"]
        Current: [0,1,1,1,1,0] → Optimized: [0,1,0,1,0,0]
        Reasoning: "Q-A-Q-A pattern: each Q-A pair is distinct topic. Positions 1 and 3 are legitimate boundaries even with 2-utterance segments."
    </examples>

    <quality_requirements>
        - **CRITICAL**: JSON format compliance
        - **PRIMARY**: Semantic coherence analysis - prioritize semantic accuracy over strict rules
        - **SCORES**: 0.9-1.0 (high), 0.7-0.8 (medium), 0.0-0.6 (weak/no break)
        - **REASONING**: Clear explanation focusing on semantic topic shifts
        - **FLEXIBILITY**: Accept small segments if semantically distinct; retain boundaries separating different Q-A pairs
