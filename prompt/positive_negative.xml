    <role>You are an expert in dialogue topic segmentation. Generate positive and negative sample pairs for model training.

    <task_definition>
        **Training Data Generation:**
        - **Positive Sample**: 7-sentence dialogue with clear topic boundary at sentence 4 (should be segmented)
        - **Negative Sample**: 7-sentence dialogue with topic continuity at sentence 4 (should NOT be segmented)

        **Key Rules:**
        1. Fixed format: 3 (previous) + 1 (current) + 3 (next) = 7 sentences
        2. Different speakers for each sentence
        3. Thematic similarity to input conversation
        4. Clear topic shift markers for positive, continuity for negative
    </task_definition>

    <instructions>
        1. Analyze input conversation theme and style
        2. Generate positive sample with topic shift at sentence 4
        3. Generate negative sample with topic continuity at sentence 4
        4. Ensure 7 sentences each with speaker alternation
        5. Output JSON format with reasoning

        {"result":{"positive":{"previous":["s1","s2","s3"],"current":"s4","next":["s5","s6","s7"],"reason":"explanation with no more than 100 words."},"negative":{"previous":["s1","s2","s3"],"current":"s4","next":["s5","s6","s7"],"reason":"explanation"}}}
        **MANDATORY**: Both samples must have exactly 7 sentences each

    <examples>
        **Example 1:**
        Input: "A: How was your weekend? B: It was great! I went hiking. A: That sounds fun. B: Yes, the weather was perfect. A: Did you take any photos? B: Lots! The views were amazing."
        
        Positive: {"previous":["A: How was your weekend?","B: It was great! I went hiking.","A: That sounds fun."],"current":"B: By the way, have you heard about the new restaurant downtown?","next":["A: No, I haven't. What's it like?","B: It's amazing! Great food and atmosphere.","A: I'll have to check it out sometime."],"reason":"'By the way' creates clear topic shift from hiking to restaurant discussion"}
        
        Negative: {"previous":["A: How was your weekend?","B: It was great! I went hiking.","A: That sounds fun."],"current":"B: Yes, the weather was perfect for outdoor activities.","next":["A: Did you go alone or with friends?","B: I went with my hiking group.","A: That must have been nice."],"reason":"Continues hiking topic with weather details, no topic shift indicators"}

        **Example 2:**
        Input: "A: I need help with my computer. B: What's the problem? A: It keeps freezing. B: Have you tried restarting it? A: Yes, but it still freezes."
        
        Positive: {"previous":["A: I need help with my computer.","B: What's the problem?","A: It keeps freezing."],"current":"B: Speaking of technology, did you see the new smartphone release?","next":["A: No, I haven't been following tech news lately.","B: It has some amazing features.","A: I might look into it when I need a new phone."],"reason":"'Speaking of technology' shifts from computer troubleshooting to smartphone discussion"}
        
        Negative: {"previous":["A: I need help with my computer.","B: What's the problem?","A: It keeps freezing."],"current":"B: Have you checked if it's overheating?","next":["A: How would I know if it's overheating?","B: The fan would be running loudly.","A: I'll check that when I get home."],"reason":"Continues computer troubleshooting by suggesting overheating as potential cause"}

        - **MANDATORY**: Both samples must have exactly 7 sentences each
        - **CRITICAL**: JSON format compliance
        - **CONSISTENT**: Speaker alternation and thematic similarity
        - **POSITIVE**: Clear topic shift markers at sentence 4
        - **NEGATIVE**: Topic continuity at sentence 4
        - **VALIDATION**: Verify sentence count before outputting
